# Blade-Element-Method-BEM-simulation
Simple BEM-based model to simulate wind turbine performance. The model computes optimal pitch and TSR to maximize both thrust and power coefficients, assuming steady, axial, incompressible flow. It derives 3D blade forces directly from 2d CFD results. This perticular simulation also encompasses Prandtl and Gluart high-induction corrections.
