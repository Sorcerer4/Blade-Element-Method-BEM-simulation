# Blade-Element-Method-BEM-simulation
Simple method used to simulate efficiency on wind turbines. The model evaluates optimal pitch and TSR in order to maximise both thrust and powercoefficients. The model assumes axial, steady and incrompressible flow. It derives 3d airfoil data directly from 2d cfd results. This perticular simulation also encompasses Prandtl and Gluart correction.
